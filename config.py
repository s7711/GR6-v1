Configuration file for GR6-v1

The configuration file is a JSON file and is read into a dictionary.
Usage:
   from config import CFG
Then CFG will exist in the scope of the file you are importing CFG into.

Note: CFG was originally passed into several classes, but it probably
makes more sense to just import it now (not likely to run several
instances with different configurations). You may find a mixture
in the code.
