THIS IS UNTESTED CODE

Used to send fake gad updates to the OXTS navigation system.
Can be used to test GAD, to keep the xNAV650 stable if GNSS is not available, etc.

Usage:
    gf = gad_fake.GadFake(CFG))
    gf.userCommand(message,path) - Updates from the webpage
    gf.stop() terminates the thread and stops sending updates.
