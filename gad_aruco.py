# Definitions for where the camera is and how it is orientated compared
# to the xNAV.

# For a rotated camera (i.e. one where the camera z-axis isn't aligned
# to the xNAV x-axis):
# C --> Camera axes (X/row 1 points right in the image frame. Y/row 2 points down in the image frame)
# c --> OxTS-style, but still rotated by H_c, P_c, R_c (camera HPR)
# b --> OxTS body frame
# V_b = C_nb(H_c, P_c, R_c) * C_cC * V_C

# Just for explicit clarity (if English allows):
# C_Cc: Rotation matrix from OxTS-style camera frame ("c") to OpenCV-style camera frame ("C")
# "c" frame axes (OxTS convention):
#   - X_c: forward (vehicle direction)
#   - Y_c: right (right side)
#   - Z_c: down (toward road)
# "C" frame axes (OpenCV convention):
#   - X_C: right in image
#   - Y_C: down in image
#   - Z_C: forward (into scene)
# "b" frame axes (OxTS body frame, or vehicle frame)
# ... is different to c because the camera might be orientated differently in the vehicle.
# We could do a transformation straight from "C" to "b", but I find it easier to
# put H_c, P_c and R_c in the configuration file, and have them with (normally) trivial rotations
# The GAD update is in the OXTS IMU frame, which is not the same as the body frame, and is
# defined by mobile.vat n the OXTS configuration files.

# To work out C_bc and C_bi:
# Start thinking from the "c" or the "i" directions
#   Rotate through Z - this is the heading, right thumb along Z axis, fingers in positive rotation direction
#   Rotate through Y - this is the pitch
#   Rotate through X - this is the roll
# so that you end up in the "b" frame
#
# The full chain of rotations is such that:
#   C_nb = C_nm * C_mM * C_MC * C_Cc * C_cb
# where:
#   C_nm - navigation to marker frame, in the map file as HmPmRm
#   C_mM - definitions, see axes above
#   C_MC - (C_CM = Rodrigues()).T from aruco code
#   C_Cc - definitions, see axes above
#   C_cb - camera mount in the vehicle
